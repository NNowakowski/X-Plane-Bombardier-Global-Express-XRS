Hi all,

After about a year of work, i am happy to release the X-Plane 11 Bombardier Global Express XRS. The XRS is a long range, large cabin business jet, that seats a maximum of 14 people. The aircraft is capable of landing on runways as short as 2300ft, fly 6400nm at mach .85 (m .89 max) and fly at altitudes up to FL510. I have included three liveries of main operators Vistajet (Standard and Vistajet for Ferrari races) and Netjets. A paintkit is not included, although it should be easy enough to repaint from either of the two supplied liveries. 

I created the Global Express in Blender 2.83. It allowed to create a true X-plane 11 model, taking advantage of all the current possibilities. The plane includes a virtual cockpit with a lot of custom gauges, a modelled interior, opening doors and a fully animated outside model.

A flightsim model is never a perfect copy of the real plane and choices have to be made creating one. Since this is version 1.0, i'm sure there will be bugs and mistakes. If you find any, or have any wishes for future updates, leave a comment below and i'll see what i can do. If you happen to be a virtual aircraft painter and you like to create better/ more realistic textures, leave a pm on x-plane.org. I can really use your help with and upgrade of the textures on this and upcoming aircraft (for example to slightly shorter Global 5000).

To answer some (likely) questions in advance:
- The XRS does have an autothrottle. To (de)activat, use the buttons on the throttle handles
- You need a running APU (to provide bleed air) to start the engines. When the APU is running, the engines are started with the black switches below the throttle.
- To activate the transponder click on the button next to 'standby' on either of the radio panels on the pedestal. Then rotate the tune button to ATC ON/ ATC ALT to turn the transponder on. 
- An almost empty Global does not land at 140 kts. You can fly much slower, around 110 kts will work. 
- To couple the autopilot to the GPS as nav source click FMS, to couple to the VOR, click V/L.
- The baro set enables to select between INHP and Hectopascal (for flights between the USA and Europe and v.v.)
- Check smartcockpit for more information on how to fly the approaches and how the systems work.

I'm not aware of any X-plane 11 sound sets that are available for the Global. If you can create one, or happen to know where to find one, please let me know. Personally i use a soundset i downloaded from fltimplus.com : https://www.ftsimplus.com/x-plane-11.html

Installation:
Copy the contents of the zip to the folder: ..\X-plane\Aircraft\Extra aircraft
(re)Start X-plane
You should find the aircraft under 'General aviation' > Global Express XRS


The Bombardier Global Express XRS was created and released as freeware. You are free to repaint and upload your repaints, as long as you give proper credits, keep it free for anyone to download and release the plane under these same conditions. 

Enjoy!
